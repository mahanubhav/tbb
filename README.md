**Emergence of The Big Brother(TBB) in 21st century: When Software Collides with Politics, Economics and Society**


### Motivation for writing on this topic

Orwellian Big Brother is a fascinating concept. It is the concept that brings both politics and technology together. The underlying political message behind The Big Brother(TBB) is very powerful, but the technology that has the capacity to bring TBB alive is even far more interesting. TBB can’t come into existence without technology, therefore some two years back in 2015 – when Edward Snowden episode was still fresh in the memory, I started working on the topic to find out technological structures behind the emergence of TBB, that somehow resulted in the form of a book. (Somewhat detailed motivation is written in the Introduction section of the book)

### How to get the book?

1. The book is available in PDF format in the [release section](https://github.com/mahanubhav/tbb/releases). It has been encrypted with symmetric cipher and requires passphrase that is also given on the release page. Users can decrypt it using GPG or other software of their choice. Now the question is why to encrypt the book in the first place itself if the passphrase for decrypting it also given? In this case, encryption has not been used for protecting the book, but actually as a way to promote the use of encryption in daily life. When it comes to encryption very few people use it and have knowledge of it. Software such as GPG has really made encryption accessible to everyone, and I think people should start using it. Those who know about GPG can easily decrypt the file with just one single command {gpg file_name}, and those who have never used encryption in any form then it will be a good exercise for them to use it for the first time.  If users are facing difficulty in decrypting the file, then they can either open up issue or they can directly send me an email requesting copy of the book. 

2. The book is also available on [amazon kindle](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07548C2K1), without DRM. If readers want to support author and his work then they can buy it from amazon. 

### Few more things about the book

1. The book has been written with software and the ecosystem surrounding it at its focal point. 

2. This book is not about how surveillance is being performed today. Digital surveillance is one of the important topics discussed in the book but it is not the main focus. It is also not about cyber crimes. The main aim of the book is to discuss the technological structures in association with politics, economics and the society, that can bring the concept of Orwellian Big Brother into reality.

#### Reporting Issues:

I never thought that writing a book could be this much tough. Every time I read it, I always come across some or other form of mistakes.  I’ve tried to minimize logical inconsistencies as much as possible, but still it is possible that I might have missed some key points. Therefore, if readers feel that there are some logical inconsistencies in the arguments presented in the book, then they should open up issue in the [issues section](https://github.com/mahanubhav/tbb/issues) . It is possible that from those issues, I might get some new insight or some new way of looking at things - which I’ve not thought about earlier.

Apart from normal issues any constructive criticism, suggestion or feedback is welcome.
