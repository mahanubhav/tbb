**Emergence of The Big Brother(TBB) in 21st century: When Software Collides with Politics, Economics and Society**


### Motivation for writing on this topic

Orwellian Big Brother is a fascinating concept. It is the concept that brings both politics and technology together. The underlying political message behind The Big Brother(TBB) is very powerful, but the technology that has the capacity to bring TBB alive is even far more interesting. TBB can’t come into existence without technology, therefore some two years back in 2015 – when Edward Snowden episode was still fresh in the memory, I started working on the topic to find out technological structures behind the emergence of TBB, that somehow resulted in the form of a book. (Somewhat detailed motivation is written in the Introduction section of the book)

### Few more things about the book

1. The book has been written with software and the ecosystem surrounding it at its focal point. 

2. The book tries to analyze factors that may be responsible for creation of surveillance state in 21st century, instead of just enumerating the ways in which digital surveillance is being performed today. The main focus of the book is to discuss opaque structures of digital technology in association with politics, economics and society, in order to understand the basis behind surveillance state.

#### Reporting Issues:

I never thought that writing a book could be this much tough. Every time I read it, I always come across some or other form of mistakes.  I’ve tried to minimize logical inconsistencies as much as possible, but still it is possible that I might have missed some key points. Therefore, if readers feel that there are some logical inconsistencies in the arguments presented in the book, then they should open up issue in the [issues section](https://github.com/mahanubhav/tbb/issues) . It is possible that from those issues, I might get some new insight or some new way of looking at things - which I’ve not thought about earlier.

Apart from normal issues any constructive criticism, suggestion or feedback is welcome.
